This section will describe the precise actions that the built-in word prediction model will take. When predicting the following word in a sentence, the model will take into account the final word. We will employ deep learning, language modelling, and natural language processing techniques. Data pre-processing will come after data analysis as our first step. Then, after tokenizing the data, we will create the deep learning model. Utilizing LSTMs, the deep learning model will be constructed.
